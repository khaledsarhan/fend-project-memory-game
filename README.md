## Instructions

The game is built using simple HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Click on the map to open it. Maps will be flipped if the next card does not match the open one. Your score will depend on the moves taken to open all the cards. The less moves, the better.

## How to play

You just need to click on the [link](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/khaledsarhan/fend-project-memory-game/blob/master/index.html) to start playing

## Dependencies

I create this game using my own dom methods to keep the code clean. It does not depend on third-party libraries. No more jQuery and Boostrap. Just HTML, CSS and JavaScript! I find that the new Udacity courses on ES6 are amazing!
